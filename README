This is another small plugin that allows OPs to give players a custom prefix.
The format is [PREFIX] <PLAYER_NAME> MESSAGE

So if I send "Hello" with the prefix of "Admin", it looks like:
[Admin] <Valrix> Hello

To set the prefix just use the /prefix command. For example, let's give me the
"Admin" prefix:

/prefix Valrix Admin
